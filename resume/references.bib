	ABSTRACT = {Image registration is a common operation in any type of image processing, specially in remote sensing images. Since the publication of the scale–invariant feature transform (SIFT) method, several algorithms based on feature detection have been proposed. In particular, KAZE builds the scale space using a nonlinear diffusion filter instead of Gaussian filters. Nonlinear diffusion filtering allows applying a controlled blur while the important structures of the image are preserved. Hyperspectral images contain a large amount of spatial and spectral information that can be used to perform a more accurate registration. This article presents HSI–KAZE, a method to register hyperspectral remote sensing images based on KAZE but considering the spectral information. The proposed method combines the information of a set of preselected bands, and it adapts the keypoint descriptor and the matching stage to take into account the spectral information. The method is adequate to register images in extreme situations in which the scale between them is very different. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested on real images taken on different dates, and presenting different types of changes. The experimental results show that the method is robust achieving image registrations with scales of up to     24 . 0 ×    .},

	abstract="Image registration is a building block for many applications in computer vision and medical imaging. However the current methods are limited when large and highly non-local deformations are present. In this paper, we introduce a new direct feature matching technique for non-parametric image registration where efficient nearest-neighbor searches find global correspondences between intensity, spatial and geometric information. We exploit graph spectral representations that are invariant to isometry under complex deformations. Our direct feature matching technique is used within the established Demons framework for diffeomorphic image registration. Our method, called Spectral Demons, can capture very large, complex and highly non-local deformations between images. We evaluate the improvements of our method on 2D and 3D images and demonstrate substantial improvement over the conventional Demons algorithm for large deformations.",

	ABSTRACT = {The Minimum Linear Arrangement problem (MinLA) consists in finding an ordering of the nodes of a weighted graph, such that the sum of the weighted edge lengths is minimized. We report on the usefulness of a new model within a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for solving MinLA problems to optimality. The key idea is to introduce binary variables d_{ijk}, that are equal to 1 if nodes i and j have distance k in the permutation. We present formulations for complete and for sparse graphs and explain the realization of a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm. Furthermore, its different settings are discussed and evaluated. To the study of the theoretical aspects concerning the MinLA, we contribute a characterization of a relaxation of the corresponding polyeder. },
